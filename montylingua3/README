 WHERE MUST THE DATAFILES BE?
 - the "datafiles" include all files ending in *.MDF
 - the best solution is to create an environment variable called
   "MONTYLINGUA" and put the path to the datafiles there
 - alternatively, MontyLingua can find the datafiles if they are 
   in the operating system "PATH" variable, or in the current
   working directory

        public yourFunction(String raw, String toked) {
           jisted = j.jist_predicates(raw); // an example function

      3. For a good use case example, see Sample.java.
